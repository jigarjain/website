title: End of my first Sabbatical
---

Today marks the end of my 10 months long sabbatical. Ever since I began school, I have never had 10 consecutive months without any obligations. I didn't really think much about what I would have liked to do during this period. The idea was always to relax & look out for something new without knowing what that could be. But it wasn't the kind of sabbatical that one usually desires. I had a mixed bag of some good days, some bad days & some ugly days. But all of them have had a larger impact on me.

I can't really say when I plan my next sabbatical. Not even sure whether I will even take one. But if I do, then I will be doing it very differently. This is not to say that I didn't get what I wanted out of my first sabbatical. I did. But now that I know myself a bit more better, I would like to get something **more** out of my next one.


**Few highlights**

- Turning my girlfriend into my fianc√©e
- Doing some permaculture gardening at Cafe Botanico
- Riding my first adult bike around town
- Finding my flow in Yoga
- Improving my fitness by working out
- Relaxing to Gong Bath
