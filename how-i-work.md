title: "How I work"

The purpose of this manual is to give you an understanding of how I think & work, my preferences & triggers, my strengths & my blindspots in less than 1000 words.¬†


#### About me  

I am Jigar & I work with Team Telesto (Immowelt) as an Engineering Manager. I come from Mumbai but Berlin has been my home now for about 6 years. I have over a decade of experience working with startups in both, individual contributor & technical leadership roles. In my previous role, I was an EM for a Search & Booking team at Quandoo.

  
#### My purpose

The 3 key areas that I focus on & keep myself accountable for are **Team mental health**, **engagement** & **productivity** (in that order). Besides, I work with engineers to ensure that they enjoy contributing to the team & are on a path to growth (personally or professionally). I collaborate with the PO to reduce ambiguity in new projects & to create both short-term & long-term roadmaps for the team.¬†Additionally, I will be pushing for more async ways of working & building a writing culture within the team.


#### How I Slack (*pun intended*)

- I use Slack for async communication mode. My response times can vary between a few seconds to a few hours. For matters requiring urgent attention, please consider using a topic-relevant channel.
- For time-sensitive problems/projects, I prefer discussions over calls rather than constant back-and-forth messaging.
- While very rare, I am guilty of sending messages outside working hours. I am replacing that with "Scheduled" messages. If you do end up receiving one, tell me & I will owe you a box of your favourite chocolate or coffee.
- My top 3 emojis by usage: 
  - ‚úÖ = completed/done
  - üëç = acknowledged/approved
  - üôÇ / üòä = positive nod/happy feeling.

  
#### Me & Meetings

- I am protective about my "Focus hours" & auto-reject the invites for meetings during those hours. If necessary, please do reach out & I will accommodate it.
- I prefer sending/receiving meeting invites with an agenda, the desired outcome & pre-meeting reads. It helps me & hopefully other participants to be mentally warmed up when joining the meeting.
- I like to know if my presence at the meeting is necessary or optional when receiving an invite. Likewise, I will mark your attendance as optional if I believe that the meeting might be useful for you but your presence isn't necessary.

  
#### Receiving/Giving Feedback

- I like to know what I didn't do well & what I could do better. I appreciate it when they are delivered closer to the connected situation rather than further down the road.
- I don't give feedback anonymously (e.g: peer feedback). This helps me to be thoughtful & accountable for my feedback. If you prefer to receive it anonymously, please let me know (members of my team always receive direct feedback).


#### My communication style

- Expressing complex thoughts in writing is easier than speaking for me. In addition, I periodically suffer from a stutter. Please let me know when I haven't clarified my thoughts or articulated myself properly.
- I tend to question ideas & solutions even if I might be agreeing with them. I do that to make sure we have considered all aspects before coming to a decision. Please do not consider that as an attack on or rejection of the idea itself.


#### Things that I am working on

- I tend to overthink & if you catch me in action doing that, then do call me out.
- I am aware that at times, I can be too focused on my team & end up ignoring the relationship with the adjoining team & their work.
- In the past, I have overlooked celebrating team success & making the team's work visible outside the team. This is something that I strive to address it going forward.
  

#### My triggers

- Meetings that are often starting late & ending late or often attended unprepared.
- When the agreed action items are often not completed.


#### Outside working hours

- I read about various Permaculture projects around the world & dream of starting my own.
- I frequently visit either a Yoga studio or a gym.
- I maintain curated playlists of music on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/82y4i4jxy3584mul2urdao0ik) in the hopes of moonlighting as a house-party DJ someday.
