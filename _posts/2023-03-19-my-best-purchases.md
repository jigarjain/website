This is the list of few items which I use quite regularly & can't imagine going back without them -

#### [Waterpik flosser](https://www.waterpik.com/oral-health/products/dental-water-flosser/WP-100/)

I never knew there was a water based flossing until a Dentist told me about it. Before using this, I had frequent gum inflammation & bleeding. I have been using this for 3 years now & I don't have any gum problems anymore.


#### [Sony ANC headphones XM4](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/headphones/headband/p/wh1000xm4-b)

I must admit that I had very different expectations from a Active Noise-cancelling headphones but these pair of headphones soon grew into me. It was my first purchase at the beginning of my last sabbatical & they have been absolutely awesome. They have become my necessary addons for flight journeys.


#### [Triban winter gloves from Decathlon](https://www.decathlon.de/p/fahrrad-winterhandschuhe-100-fleece)

A relatively cheap purchase but I think they are the only pair of gloves which fits snuggly on my hands & ! enjoy wearing them. They are warm enough for Berlin winter & windchill (I found them comfortable enough in temperatures upto -10°C).


#### [Google Pixel 7 Pro](https://store.google.com/product/pixel_7_pro)

After using budget Motorola phones exclusively for last 12 years, I finally purchased my first flagship phone from Google. The biggest reason for this purchase was it"s superior photo quality & so far it has done the best job for me.


#### [Ragazzi MTB from Ebay](/assets/images/posts/first-bike.jpg)

Another purchase from/for sabbatical was my MTB which I purchased from second-hand marketplace on Ebay for 40€. Honestly, I should have got a bike much sooner than I did. But now that I have one, I can't see myself without one.


I do have few more things in my wishlist since a while which I hope would make it to this list next time - 
- A GaN USB-C 140W multiport charger (probably Anker)
- High fidelity ear plugs for festivals/clubs (probably Loop or Earpeace)
- Isthmus Parka from Patagonia (Unfortunately, they stopped making it in a color I really liked)
