title: Things I believe in

1. Respect the time of other people. Be punctual. Deliver on time which is mutually agreed upon. If for some reason, you can't make it on time, then let them know upfront much before. Don't schedule needless meetings & invite needless people. Keep meetings opt-in rather than opt-out.

2. Dreams are cheap. Turning them into reality is costly. It costs hard work. Lot of it. It is fun & even good to dream and let imagination run wild. But know when to stop & start working towards it.

3. Be very mindful about what you put in your body. Don't eat/drink/smoke/consume out of a habit.

4. Make your own decisions. If they turn out to be bad, look at no one else for blame. If they turn out to be good, look at no one else for praise.
