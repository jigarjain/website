Reading about this whole Apple's fiasco (scanning phone contents for detecting child-abuse content), I would like to iterate my belief - Just as no one cares about your own life more than you do; No one would care about your privacy more than you should. Every time you would read/hear "We care about your privacy", softly say "No, you don't".
