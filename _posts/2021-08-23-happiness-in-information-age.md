title: Happiness in Information Age
---

In this Information Age, I believe that one way to stay happy is to be ignorant. To be ignorant about all the evil which is out there in the world. To be ignorant about all the pain & suffering of the people out there. Ignorance is bliss. Ignorance could keep you happy in your own world that you have carved out for yourself. Ignorance would still keep your empathy levels high. Ignorance wouldn't take away your ability to "feel". To be happy, be ignorant. Now on the other hand, if you are seeking not happiness but equanimity, then ignorance wouldn't grant you that.
