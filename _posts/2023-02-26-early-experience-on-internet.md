title: Early experience on Internet
---

Few days ago, I was thinking about how my experience in my early days of Internet had been. When I was in my High School, we had something called Cyber Cafes. It's where you would go to check your emails, do some real research on school/college projects and use Orkut/MySpace to connect with your friends & some NSFW stuff. I did neither of those. I used Cyber Cafes only to check the results of my High School & College entrance exams.

I got my first phone (Nokia 1100) in 2008 & which was a basic GSM phone. It was only in next year when I got Moto Slvr L9 (thus beginning my 13 year long journey with Motorola) I got access to Internet via GPRS. It was also the time when I got my first Computer at home with a broadband connection. 2009 was the year when my journey into Internet world properly began. For a context, I was already in 2nd year of my CS course when I had access to a computer & internet at home.

Apart from college work, I did spend alot of time on Internet meeting strangers & making friends. And I didn't do that on Facebook or Twitter. But I did that on a site called [Peperonity.com](https://twitter.com/peperonitycom). It hosted many popular public chat rooms. I met so many people from all over the world in those chatrooms, some of whom even became my good friends. While I moved out of India in 2017, I was already exploring the world beginning 2009 & talking to so many people from all over. Some of those online connecitons even converted to real world connections. It was also there where I set my first blog before moving to Wordpress. That's where I also got introduced to Wapsites - a place where one could download ringtones, songs, videos, wallpapers & games.

It was a shame that they had to shut it down because they couldn't keep up with the massive transformation in the social media space on Internet. Nevertheless, Peperonity.com was my first Internet platform & it was very close to my heart. At times, I still miss that experience. But I am thankful that it once existed in my life.
