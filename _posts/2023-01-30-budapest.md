We came back last week from our trip to Budapest. This made Budapest to be the only European city which I have visited two times purely for leisure purposes. And of all the capital cities that I have been to, I find Budapest to probably be the most beautiful one. And thanks to my new phone, I was able to capture better than average pictures (I think so).


The Budapest parliament has to be in the top 3 most beautiful parliament buildings on this planet.

The ceiling of the Dohány Synagogue. My first visit to a Synagogue.

One of the churches which is always so picture perfect. The inside of the church is even crazier.

Well, not all buildings are pretty. But they all have history.

A beautifully painted door in Kazinczy Street right next to Szimpla Kert.
