title: Chasing Euphoria
---

One of the goals for this year it to find ways for me to get in the state of euphoria without use of any substances. And I think I found one in last couple of weeks. An intense workout in gym immediately followed by a sauna session & then a bike ride back home, feeling the cold wintery air on my face. It's almost addictive & I love it.
